# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Cars
Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) of cars data-set from Kaggle. 

To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10,000 rows and more than 10 columns
which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. 

So, I will explore the data and make it ready for modeling.
